# Assignment 003 - Practicing Directives

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## Tasks

1. Add a button which says 'Display Details'
2. Add a paragraph with any content of your choice (e.g. 'Secret Password = tuna')
3. Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button from the first step
4. Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (maybe log a timestamp or simply an incrementing number)
5. Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log terms a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (via ngClass)
